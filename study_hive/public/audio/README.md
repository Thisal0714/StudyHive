# Timer Audio Files

This directory contains audio files for the StudyHive timer functionality.

## Required Files

- `timer-complete.wav` - Sound that plays when the study session timer completes

## How to Add Your Own Timer Sound

1. **Find a suitable audio file**: Look for short (1-3 second) notification sounds that are:
   - Not too jarring or loud
   - Clear and recognizable
   - In WAV or MP3 format (WAV recommended for better compatibility)

2. **Recommended sources for free sounds**:
   - [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) - Community-driven sound library
   - [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/) - Free sound effects
   - [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/) - Professional sound library
   - [Notification Sounds](https://notificationsounds.com/) - Dedicated notification sounds

3. **Replace the placeholder**:
   - Download your chosen audio file
   - Rename it to `timer-complete.wav` (or update the code to use your preferred format)
   - Replace the existing placeholder file in this directory

4. **Audio specifications**:
   - Format: WAV or MP3 (WAV recommended)
   - Duration: 1-3 seconds
   - Volume: Moderate (not too loud)
   - Quality: 44.1kHz sample rate or higher

## Testing

Once you've added the audio file, you can test it by:
1. Going to the dashboard
2. Clicking "Start Study Session"
3. Clicking the "ðŸ”Š Test Sound" button in the timer modal

The sound will also automatically play when your study session timer completes.

## Fallback Sound

If no audio file is found or if the browser blocks audio playback, the app will automatically play a built-in beep sound using the Web Audio API. This ensures you'll always get a notification when your timer completes.
